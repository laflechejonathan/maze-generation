## Maze Generation Sandbox

### What is this?

Playing around with maze generation algorithms as well as different search approaches.  I'm using matplotlib to visualize the resulst.

### TODO

* Fix animation saving so it doesn't take so long
* Implement 'minimal spanning tree' maze generation approach
